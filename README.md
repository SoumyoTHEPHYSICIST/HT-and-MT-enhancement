#README: Enhancement of Heat and Mass Transfer in Weakly Viscoelastic Fluids
Enhancement of Heat and Mass Transfer in Second-Order and Viscoelastic Fluids: Effects of Weak Elasticity on Nusselt and Sherwood Correlations
Overview

This project investigates the enhancement of heat and mass transfer rates in weakly viscoelastic fluids under shear and Poiseuille flows. The analysis begins with the Second-Order Fluid (SOF) approximation, based on the work of Ganesh Subramanian & Donald Koch (2006, 2007), and is extended toward finite Weissenberg number (Wi) models such as FENE-P and Oldroyd-B.

The study focuses on how Deborah number (De) and the viscoelastic parameter Îµ influence:

Convective vs. advective transport mechanisms.
Nusselt (Nu) and Sherwood (Sh) correlations.
Flow stability and particle migration.
The plots generated show the dependence of Nu (or Sh) vs. PÃ©clet number (Pe) for different Îµ values at increasing Deborah numbers (De=0.01, 0.1, 0.2).

ðŸ”¬ Methodology

Base Model: Lambâ€™s solution for flow around a sphere in Newtonian fluid.
Viscoelastic Extension: Weak elasticity correction using SOF theory (O(De) expansion).
Heat & Mass Transfer: Nu and Sh computed as functions of Pe, with Îµ controlling viscoelastic stress contributions.
Trajectory Simulations: Mathematica streamplots and parametric ODE integration show how particles spiral or migrate in shear flow with weak viscoelasticity.

Code:

Python for plotting correlations.
Mathematica for symbolic velocity fields and particle trajectories.

ðŸ“Š Key Results & Plots

At low Pe, conduction dominates; Nu (or Sh) is nearly unaffected by Îµ.
At moderate/high Pe, convection is enhanced with weaker Îµ (closer to -0.1), leading to higher Nu/Sh.
Increasing De systematically enhances transfer rates by increasing advective contribution.
Streamplots show spiraling particle migration, with trajectories modified by viscoelastic stresses.
